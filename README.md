# Telcho-Churn-Analysis
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning. It applies techniques like resampling and models like Gradient Boosting to improve recall, minimize False Negatives (FN), and reduce churn prediction costs. Model evaluation and tuning are also covered.
